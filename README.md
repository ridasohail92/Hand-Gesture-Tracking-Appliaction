## Project Overview

Our project aims to implement a sophisticated hand gesture tracking system using MediaPipe and OpenCV. The primary goal is to develop a functional hand gesture recognition system, with a focus on creating a virtual calculator application that allows users to perform mathematical operations using hand gestures. The project also seeks to enhance the system's accuracy and usability by refining the tracking algorithm and ensuring seamless integration with the calculator application. As a moonshot, we aim to expand the hand tracking technology to a secondary application, demonstrating its adaptability in diverse fields, such as sign language recognition.

The core direction of our project revolves around the implementation of an innovative system that can revolutionize user interfaces and applications. Hand gesture recognition holds significant potential in various domains, and our initial focus on a virtual calculator application serves as a practical demonstration of its capabilities. However, we envision a broader impact by potentially applying this technology to assist in sign language recognition or other fields, depending on time constraints.

Our team is dedicated not only to achieving the set milestones but also to exploring the technology's potential beyond the immediate scope of our primary application. This project represents our commitment to technological innovation and creating tangible solutions that can benefit diverse user needs.
